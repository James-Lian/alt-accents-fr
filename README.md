# Alt-Accents (FR): A Chrome Extenion for easy input of French accents
Are you a laptop user? Are you unable to use Alt codes? Do you find installing new languages on your OS time-consuming and difficult to use?
Worry not! Alt-Accents (FR) allows you to input French accents with simple hotkeys (é è ê).
One hotkey is all that is necessary, but if you wish to enhance your experience, you can use more. Check out [chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts) for all of the shortcuts.

## Instructions
1. Place your cursor inside whatever editable item where you want to type your French accent.
2. 'Activate' the extension by pressing the hotkey `activate-accents` (default `Alt+W`). This will show an overlay containing a list of all French accents.
3. While holding the modifier key (which in this case is `Alt`), continue pressing the letter key (`W`) to cycle through the list. Control whether your accents are lower or uppercase using `CapsLock`. Your selected accent will be highlighted in red.
4. You may also make use of other shortcuts like `move-selection-down` (default `Alt+S`) and `move-selection-left` (default `Alt+A`) to select your efficiently select your accents.
5. Upon reaching your desired accent, release the modifier key to deactivate the extension. The overlay will disappear, and your French accent will be insterted wherever your mouse cursor is.
6. Use the `copy-accents` hotkey (default `Alt+P`) to copy an entire list of French accents like so. é è ê à ç ù « » ë ï ü â ô î û É È Ê À Ç Ù « » Ë Ï Ü Â Ô Î Û
7. *Amusez-vous à écrire en français!*

## Want to use this extension for yourself?
Chrome Web Store charges a $5 fee to allow developers to publish their own extensions, which I don't find very enticing 😅. If you want to use this extension for yourself...
1. Download the entire folder as a ZIP file, and extract it.
2. Go to chrome://extensions, and turn on Developer mode (top-right)
3. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder.
The extension should now be installed onto your browser. Feel free to use it as you wish.
